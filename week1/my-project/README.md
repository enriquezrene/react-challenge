# Summary

## Babel
- Babel is needed to transform ES6/7 into ES5 which is supported for the current browsers
- Babel will also translate JSX into ES5

## Webpack
Webpack bundles all your JavaScript together into a single file. This includes each JavaScript file that you write as well as your npm packages.

### Why Bundle?
A single .js file is easier to deploy and will usually download faster than multiple small files.
